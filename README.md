### "Features":

> supported features are marked as done

1. [x] All variable names must start with â‚¬

2. [x] Functions definition and function call

3. [x] `echo` to print

4. [x] support for numerical data types

5. [ ] Code blocks are defined by indentation
    1. 1 level of indentation: 2 spaces
    2. 4 spaces -> 1 tab  
       ex: 3 levels of indentation = 1 tab + 2 spaces

6. [ ] Odd number of spaces and tab (combined) are comments

7. [ ] Multiline coments start with 1 tab + 1 space and end with 1 space and 1 tab

8. [x] Has `null`

9. [ ] `if` statement doesn't exit, we use `unless` statement instead
    - _value_ `unless` _not_condition_

10. [ ] The `unless` statement ends with a greek question mark Í¾ (which is not a semi-colon)

11. [x] There's only one exception, and it is `HALT_AND_CATCH_FIRE` (yes, it is a reserved keyword)

12. [ ] Inference equality (like javascript)
    - `0 = '0'` is false
    - `0 == ''` is true
    - `0 == '0'` is true
    - `0 == 'Zero'` is true
    - `22/7 == ðŸ¥§` is true
    - `undefined !=! null` is true

13. [ ] strict equality
    - If you wish for strict inequality, put a bang! after the equal, cause it is an important check!
    - ex: `1 != '1'` is false but `1 !=! '1'` is true
    - If you wish for strict _equality_, inverse the result of the strict inequality with a band ! before it!
    - ex: `1 == '1'` is true but `1 !!=! '1'` is false

14. [x] Strings (partially implemented. For now, only one type and it is utf-8)
    - 'Hello' // ASCII
    - ''Hello''          // ANSI
    - "Hello"            // DBSC
    - ""Hello""          // EBCDIC
    - Â«HelloÂ» // UTF-256
    - Â«Â«Hello ${name}Â»Â» // UTF-256 + interpolation

15. [ ] Arrays
    - Arrays indices start at -1 and go down
